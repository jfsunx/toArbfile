# `toArbfile` - Convert Waveform Data to ARB File

The `toArbfile` is a Python function for converting waveform data into ARB file format. 
ARB files are used to describe analog signal waveforms and are commonly employed in instrument control and signal generation applications.

## Functionality

The key steps of the `toArbfile` function are as follows:

1. Calculate the maximum and minimum values of the waveform data.
2. Determine the amplitude range of the waveform data for conversion to DAC levels.
3. Convert the waveform data from voltage values to DAC levels (integer values).
4. Create an ARB file based on the provided filename and write formatted information to the file.
5. Write the converted waveform data to the file.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the `toArbfile` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create sample waveform data
fs = 50
t = np.arange(0, 100, 1/fs)
x = 5 + 10 * np.sin(1 * 2 * np.pi * t) + np.sin(10 * 2 * np.pi * t)

# Set the sampling rate and output file name
samplerate = fs
fName = 'example'

# Call the toArbfile function to convert the waveform data to an ARB file
toArbfile(x, samplerate, fName)
```

In the above example, we first generate sample waveform data `x`, then set the sampling rate and output file name. Finally, we call the `toArbfile` function to convert the waveform data into an ARB file. The generated ARB file will be saved in the current working directory with the filename appended with the `.arb` extension.

## Note

- Make sure that you have NumPy library installed as the code uses NumPy for array operations.
- The generated ARB file will contain information about the waveform data and can be used in instruments or applications that support the ARB file format.
- You can modify the code as needed to accommodate different waveform data and file names.
- To convert different waveform data to ARB files, simply replace the sample waveform data `x` and specify a different filename.
